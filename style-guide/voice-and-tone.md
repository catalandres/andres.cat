4. **Analysis/Proposal (1500-2500 words)**: [Detailed explanation] + [Examples]
   - Clear H2/H3 subsections
   - Concrete examples with code/screenshots
   - Bulleted lists for features
   - Block quotes for official definitions
   - Footnotes for additional context
5. **Implementation**: [Concrete steps] + [Code if applicable]
6. **Considerations**: [Limitations] + [Trade-offs]
7. **Roadmap/Future**: [Current state] + [Expected evolution]

### Characteristic patterns

**General flow**:
1. **General concept/definition**: Introduce the topic with a broad definition or context
2. **Specific Salesforce context**: Narrow down to how it applies within the Salesforce ecosystem
3. **Problem to solve**: Present the challenge or question that the post will address

**Example flow**:
```
"Feature fiction: [Concept]" →
"As developers, we constantly encounter..." →
"The problem lies in..." →
"Imagine for a moment that Salesforce implemented..." →
"This would work as follows..." →
"Of course, there are considerations..." →
"While we wait for this to materialize..."
```

### Distinctive elements

- **Rhetorical questions**: "Is that your case? If so, think again!"
- **Smooth transitions**: "As I see it...", "All in all...", "While we wait..."
- **Controlled emphasis**: Strategic exclamations ("G-d forbid!")
- **Reader invitations**: "Let's take a closer look!"
- **Culinary metaphors**: "sit-down restaurant vs. kitchen counter", "turducken de Visualforce"
- **Visual analogies**: "equivalent of glitter", "Twister game"

## Chronicle/opinion posts

### Voice and tone characteristics

   - Personal anecdote or cultural reference
   - Observation that breaks expectations
   - Sets tone: curious, critical, fun
2. **Context**: [Event/situation] + [Why it's relevant]
3. **Key Observations (500-1000 words)**: [2-4 main sections]

5. **Closing (100 words)**: [Personal reflection] + [Cultural nod]
   - Reflection that transcends specific topic
   - Connection to broader themes
   - Memorable ending (cultural reference, open question)

### Required elements

- Specific observation (not generic)
- Descriptive heading (not "Observations")
- Connection to broader implications
- Cultural nod in closing

### Characteristic patterns

**General flow**:
1. **Event or observation**: Start with a specific event or observation that sets the stage
2. **Contextualize the issue**: Explain why this observation is relevant to the Salesforce ecosystem
3. **Analysis**: Offer insights or critiques based on the observation and context

**Example flow**:
