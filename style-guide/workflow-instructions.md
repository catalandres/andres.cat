# Workflow instructions

## Automatic activation

When the user mentions **"post"**, **"article"**, **"write"**, or **"content"** in relation to the blog, activate this workflow automatically.

## Standard procedure

### Step 1: Identify type and context

Ask concisely:

```
What type of post do you have in mind?
• Technical/Salesforce
• Chronicle/Opinion
• Creative/Quantum Songbook

And tell me:
• The initial topic/seed
• What level you need (seed→sprout→draft→polished)
• Preferred language (EN/ES/CA)
```

### Step 2: Apply corresponding resources

According to identified type and language, consult:

- `post-templates.md` for structure
- `voice-and-tone.md` for style
- `audience-context.md` for focus

**Core style rules**:
- `style.md` for formatting, punctuation, and cross-language rules

**Language-specific guidance**:
- English: `lexicon-en.md`
- Spanish: `lexicon-es.md`  
- Catalan: `lexicon-ca.md`

**Terminology consistency**:
- `terminology-technical.md` for general tech terms
- `terminology-salesforce.md` for platform-specific terms
- `translation.md` for cross-language equivalencies

**Multilingual considerations**:
- `multilingual-guidelines.md` for translation strategy

### Step 3: Progressive development

#### Seed → sprout (Initial expansion)

- Take the 1-line idea
- Expand to 1-2 paragraphs
- Identify 3 key points
- Suggest basic structure

#### Sprout → draft (Complete structure)

- Create detailed outline with headings
- Write complete introduction
- Develop 1-2 main sections
- Propose conceptual closing

#### Draft → polished (Refinement)

- Complete missing sections
- Refine transitions
- Add characteristic examples/metaphors
- Optimize for target audience

### Step 4: Iterative delivery

- **Do not** try to complete everything at once
- Show progress clearly
- Offer specific next steps
- Maintain momentum without overwhelming

## Specific rules by type

### Technical posts

- Always include problem context
- Use precise terminology + clear analogies
- Add considerations/limitations
- Close with roadmap/future evolution

### Chronicles/opinion

- Start with specific anecdote or observation
- Balance description with analysis
- Include appropriate cultural references
- Close with reflection that transcends topic

### Quantum songbook

- Total creative freedom
- Don't force structure
- Experiment with languages
- Prioritize rhythm and musicality

## Always include elements

### In technical posts

- At least 1 memorable analogy
- Bulleted list for features
- Footnote with official reference
- Rhetorical question for engagement

### In chronicles

- Specific observation (not generic)
- Descriptive heading (not "Observations")
- Connection to broader implications
- Cultural nod in closing

### In all

- Clear transitions between sections
- Appropriate length by type (see `audience-context.md`)
- Consistent tone with `voice-and-tone.md`
- Specific call to action

## Clarification questions

### If idea is vague

- "What specific problem do you want to address?"
- "Is there any event/experience that motivated it?"
- "What should the reader understand after reading this?"

### If type isn't clear

- "Is it more important to explain the 'how' or the 'why'?"
- "Are there specific technical aspects to cover?"
- "Are you responding to something you saw/read?"

### If audience isn't defined

- "Who is your ideal reader for this post?"
- "What technical level do you assume?"
- "Is there specific context they need?"

## Maintain momentum

### After each delivery

- Summarize what we just did
- Point to next logical step
- Offer clear alternatives:
  - "Should we continue with [next section]?"
  - "Should we refine what we have?"
  - "Should we shift focus toward [alternative]?"

### Signs of blockage

- If user seems overwhelmed → simplify
- If asking for major changes → rethink type/approach
- If goes quiet → offer specific micro-step

## Final quality

### Before considering "finished"

- ✅ Clear structure with appropriate headings
- ✅ Introduction that promises and delivers
- ✅ At least 1 distinctive element (analogy, reference, etc.)
- ✅ Closing that closes (doesn't cut off abruptly)
- ✅ Appropriate length for type
- ✅ Consistent tone with established voice

### Red flags to review

- ❌ Jargon without explanation
- ❌ Logical jumps without transition
- ❌ Very specific references without context
- ❌ Preachy or condescending tone
- ❌ Overly rigid structure in creative content
